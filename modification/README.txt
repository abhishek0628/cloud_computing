Project Title: Optimizing Cost-Efficient SFC Routing in Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs)
Method: Genetic Algorithm (GA)
Student: Abhay ,Abhishek,Vishal

Description:
This project uses a Genetic Algorithm to find the most cost-efficient route for Service Function Chains (SFCs) in satellite networks (NTNs). The algorithm minimizes routing delay, CPU load, and energy consumption.

How to Run:
1. Open VS Code.
2. Open terminal and run: python ga_sfc_routing.py
3. Output:
   - Best Route
   - Minimum Cost
   - Cost vs Generations Plot (saved automatically)
